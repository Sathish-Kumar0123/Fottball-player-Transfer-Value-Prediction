⚽ Football Transfer Market Value Prediction – ML Pipeline 📌 Project Overview

The Football Transfer Market Value Prediction project aims to estimate a football player’s market value (in millions) using historical performance statistics, demographic attributes, and club-related features. The project implements a complete machine learning pipeline, starting from raw data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and comparative analysis.

This work is part of an internship-based collaborative project where each team member contributes independently through dedicated GitHub branches.

🎯 Problem Statement

Accurately predicting a football player’s market value is challenging due to the influence of multiple dynamic factors such as performance metrics, age, position, league competitiveness, and historical trends. Traditional valuation methods are subjective and inconsistent.

This project addresses the problem by applying data-driven machine learning techniques to predict player market value more reliably and objectively.

💡 Motivation

To replace subjective valuation with quantitative, data-driven predictions

To gain hands-on experience in end-to-end machine learning pipelines

To analyze and compare multiple regression models

To understand real-world challenges in sports analytics and financial forecasting

🔁 Machine Learning Pipeline Step 1: Data Collection

Player statistics, demographic details, and historical market values were collected from structured datasets.

Data includes numerical and categorical attributes relevant to valuation.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling and normalization

Removing inconsistencies and outliers

Step 3: Feature Engineering

Selection of relevant attributes impacting market value

Transformation of raw features into model-friendly formats

Step 4: Model Development

The following noticeable machine learning models were implemented:

Random Forest Regressor

LightGBM Regressor

These models were selected due to their robustness, ability to handle non-linear relationships, and strong performance on tabular data.

Step 5: Ensemble Strategy

Predictions from multiple models were combined using averaging techniques

Ensemble learning improved stability and generalization performance

Step 6: Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

R² Score

This ensured both accuracy and reliability of predictions.

Step 7: Visualization & Prediction

Actual vs Predicted market value comparisons

Error analysis plots

Final prediction of player market value in millions

📊 Results & Observations

Ensemble-based approaches performed better than individual models

Random Forest showed strong baseline performance

LightGBM provided improved efficiency and generalization

The final ensemble achieved lower error metrics and better prediction stability
